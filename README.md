I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but, in the 21st century, eddie munson would be a dream stan. I’m just saying. I mean come on, dream plays a villain in a minecraft roleplay, which is a lot like d&d by the way! So yeah all you eddie munson having profile pictures who hate on dream smp fans… you’re backin’ the wrong horse buddy.
